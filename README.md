"extRas" is a mini-volume in the ReCentering Psych Stats series that is devoted to some of the technical tools and processes used that just do not fit easily in the regular volumes (e.g., ANOVA, psychometrics, multivariate). The examples and instructions may be somewhat limiting in that they have a specific use-case for graduate students in psychology programs at our institution.
